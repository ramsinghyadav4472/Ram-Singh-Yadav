## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m a passionate beginner in **DevOps and Cloud Computing**, focused on building a strong foundation in **virtualization, containerization, microservices, and automation**.

I am continuously learning and gaining hands-on experience with tools like **AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, and Linux** through real-world projects and practical labs. My goal is to design, deploy, and manage **scalable, secure, and reliable systems**, while deepening my understanding of **cloud infrastructure and DevOps best practices**.

💡 I enjoy exploring how **automation, containerization, and cloud platforms** work together to improve system reliability, performance, and scalability. My learning journey includes deploying microservices, managing relational databases like **MySQL and PostgreSQL**, and building **CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins and Ansible.
